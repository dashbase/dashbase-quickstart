# Dashbase Quickstart

Use this guide to start Dashbase locally and familiarize yourself with a few concepts.

### Requirements

- [Docker Engine 17.06.0+](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)
- Optionally [Docker Compose 1.17.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
- At least 10GB of memory available to the Docker Engine (For macOS, click the Docker icon in the menu bar. Choose Preferences -> Advanced. Then move the slider of the memory setting to 10 GB or above)

### Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone this git repo.
git clone https://github.com/dashbase/dashbase-quickstart.git

# 2. Initialize a Docker Swarm
docker swarm init

# 3. Run our prepare script to automatically download your license and configure SSL support for Dashbase.
./bin/prepare.sh {{ YOUR REGISTERED DASHBASE.IO EMAIL }}

# 4. Deploy the base stack locally.
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml quickstart

# 5. Wait a few moments, then ensure all services are up and running.
docker service ls
```

Once all services are up, let's run a Filebeat locally to start putting in some data.

1. Get [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html) if you don't have it already.

2. Edit the `filebeat.yml` Elasticsearch output section, as such:

*Note that your license was retrieved as part of the ./bin/prepare.sh script you executed earlier.

```
#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Array of hosts to connect to.

  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

  protocol: https
  ssl.verification_mode: none

  username: ${DASHBASE_EMAIL}
  password: ${DASHBASE_LICENSE}
```

3. Start Filebeat and then visit our Dashbase [Web Interface](https://localhost:8080) to begin searching your logs!

# Dashbase using Docker on AWS

Use this guide to start Dashbase on AWS.

### Requirements

- [Docker Engine 17.06.0+](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) installed on each host if you already have machines provisioned.
- Optionally [AWS CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)

### Setup - Skip this section if you already have instances provisioned and Docker Engine installed.

Use the CloudFormation template provided [by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-aws/#deployment-options) to set up a Swarm cluster on AWS.

Configuration:

### Instructions

This section has reference to Docker swarm mode [node](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/#nodes) concepts. If you are unfamiliar, please visit the link and read Docker's description.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository and SCP it to a/the Docker swarm manager node.
git clone https://github.com/dashbase/dashbase-quickstart.git
scp -i {{ PATH/TO/SSH/KEY }} -r dashbase-quickstart docker@{{ HOSTIP }}:~/dashbase-quickstart

# 2. SSH to a Docker swarm manager node instance.
ssh -i {{ PATH/TO/SSH/KEY }} docker@{{ HOSTIP }}

# Note: you will need your AWS credentials set before running the next step.
# This can be done via using the AWS CLI or exporting the env variables.
# Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html
# This is only necessary because the REX-ray Docker volume plugin requires an IAM user with the EBS permissions.
# For inquiries, please reference their documentation.
# 3. Run our prepare script to automatically download your license and configure SSL support for Dashbase.
./bin/prepare.sh {{ YOUR REGISTERED DASHBASE.IO EMAIL }}
# Answer `y` for all prompts.

# 4. Run the docker rexray volume plugin command generated by the prepare script as a service on all nodes.
swarm-exec "$(cat rexray_cmd)"

# 5. Deploy the stack.
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml {{ YOUR STACK NAME }}

# 6. Wait a few moments, then ensure all services are up and running.
docker service ls
```
